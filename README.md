# VoiceTextInput
This repository contains a sample iOS application. The app features a form with several text fields. By performing a long press, the underline of a text field turns orange, indicating it is ready for voice input. You can then dictate what you want to be written. This code serves as the base implementation referenced in the accompanying post.[Seamless text input with your voice in iOS](https://javios.eu/blog)
